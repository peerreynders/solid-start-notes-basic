# SolidStart Notes (basic)

Updated for SolidStart v0.4.11 (new beta, [first beta version](https://github.com/peerreynders/solid-start-notes-basic/tree/2fe3462b30ab9008576339648f13d9457da3ff5f)). 
The app is a port of the December 2020 [React Server Components Demo](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo/blob/main/LICENSE); [no pg fork](https://github.com/pomber/server-components-demo/)) but here it's just a basic client side routing implementation.
It doesn't use a database but stores the notes via the [Unstorage Node.js Filesystem (Lite) driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/fs#nodejs-filesystem-lite) . This app is not intended to be deployed but simply serves as an experimental platform.


The longer term goal is to eventually leverage island routing to maximum effect once it's more stable and documented ([nksaraf](https://github.com/nksaraf) already demonstrated that [capability](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/3f086d7660a6e29dea649e80ea5a7d2fc1ff5910/archived_examples/notes) ([live demo](https://notes-server-components.vinxi.workers.dev/)) with a non-standard branch of SolidStart).
